# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Being a new programmer can be tough and discouraging but I learned so much about coding and using different types of programs just by reading and practicing on my own. I made a study guide website to help people who are new to programming or just need a refernce or a refresher on the subjects they are learning. Everything I did throughout this project helped me learn the fundementals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and how it all comes into play when building a website.
