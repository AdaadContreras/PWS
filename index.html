        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how a webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The special wild card symbol, or *. In this rule, declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0.
          </li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.  Example: [h1] style="color:red;">Prework study Guide.[/h1]</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet: Prefferd in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

        <H2>JavaScript</H2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming langugae that can add interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Java script is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.</li>
          <li>With JavaScript you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive 
            database-driven apps, and much more.</li>
            <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
            <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when
              you need to seperate statements at the end of each statement.</li>
              <li>String: This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.</li>
              <li>Number: This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
              <li>Boolean: This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
              <li>Array: This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
              <li>Object: This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
              <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement.</li>
              <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to rescue.</li>
              <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that
                listen for activity in the browser, and run code in reposne.</li>
                <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.
                </li>
                <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later.</li>
